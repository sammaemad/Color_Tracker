This is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload a video and track objects of a specific color. The application uses OpenCV to process the video and detect objects based on the selected color range.

## Features

- Upload videos in formats like `.mp4`, `.mov`, and `.avi`.
- Select a color to track from a predefined list (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, Orange, Purple, Pink).
- Visualize the tracked objects in real-time with bounding boxes and labels.
